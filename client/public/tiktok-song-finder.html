    <h2>Common TikTok Song Search Questions</h2>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>What if the TikTok uses original sound?</h3>
        <p>If the TikTok creator used an original sound (their own audio), our tool will tell you it's original. However, if they used a remix or sample of a known song, we can often identify the original track.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can I find sped up or slowed down songs?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Many TikTok songs are sped up or slowed down versions. Our audio recognition technology can identify both the original song and common remixes. TikTok loves nightcore (sped up) and slowed+reverb versions, and we can detect the original track in most cases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Does it work with viral TikTok trends?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Our TikTok song finder is perfect for identifying music from viral trends, dance challenges, and popular sounds. We track the most trending TikTok songs daily.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can it identify songs when people are talking over the music?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Many TikToks have creators talking, doing voiceovers, or making sounds while music plays in the background. Our tool uses advanced audio filtering to reduce voice frequencies and focus on the background music, making it possible to identify songs even when there's dialogue or speech over them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>What if TikTok shows "Sound not available"?</h3>
        <p>When TikTok removes audio due to copyright, our tool can still identify it if you have the video URL before it was muted. For currently muted videos, we won't be able to extract audio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Does it work with private or friends-only TikToks?</h3>
        <p>No, the video must be publicly accessible for our tool to extract and analyze the audio. Make sure the TikTok is set to public before using our song finder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>How is this different from Shazam?</h3>
        <p>Shazam requires you to play the audio and have it listen through your microphone. Our tool works directly with the TikTok URL - no need to play anything aloud. This is especially useful when you're in a quiet place, have headphones on, or the TikTok audio quality isn't great on your device speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can I use this for TikTok songs not available in my country?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Our tool analyzes the actual audio from the video, regardless of geographic restrictions. If you can access the TikTok video, we can identify the song, even if it's region-locked on streaming platforms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Finding TikTok Songs Successfully</h2>
    <div class="feature-box">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use the full TikTok URL</strong> - Copy the complete link, not shortened versions</li>
            <li><strong>Check if it's original audio</strong> - Look for the creator's name on the sound icon first</li>
            <li><strong>Try different parts of the video</strong> - Our tool samples multiple segments automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Look for the official sound page</strong> - Tap the spinning disc icon to see if others used the same sound</li>
            <li><strong>Search lyrics if you hear them</strong> - Sometimes combining our tool with a lyrics search helps</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <a href="/" class="cta-button">🎵 Identify Your TikTok Song Now</a>

    <h2>How TikTok Song Identification Works</h2>
    <p>Our TikTok song finder uses advanced audio fingerprinting technology. When you submit a TikTok URL, we:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Extract the audio from the TikTok video</li>
        <li>Analyze the audio waveform and create a unique fingerprint</li>
        <li>Compare it against millions of songs in our database</li>
        <li>Return the matching song with artist information and streaming links</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This entire process takes less than 30 seconds and works with TikTok videos from any country or language.</p>

            <li>Check if it's marked as "original sound" by the creator</li>
            <li>Look for the full version of the video (some clips are too short)</li>

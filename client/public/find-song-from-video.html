    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>What if the video has multiple songs?</h3>
        <p>Our tool samples multiple segments of the video and identifies the most prominent song. If a video has multiple songs, we'll identify the one that plays during the segments we analyze (typically the first 30 seconds of the video).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Does it work with private videos?</h3>
        <p>The video must be accessible via the URL you provide. If you can view the video with the link, our tool can analyze it. Completely private or password-protected videos won't work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Can it identify instrumental music?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Our tool identifies instrumental music, classical pieces, lo-fi beats, and songs without vocals. The audio fingerprinting technology works with any type of music.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>What if there's dialogue or narration over the music?</h3>
        <p>Our advanced audio filtering technology can isolate background music even when there's speech, dialogue, voiceovers, or sound effects. This is common in YouTube videos and Instagram Reels, and our tool handles it automatically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>How long do videos need to be?</h3>
        <p>We can work with videos of any length. We extract and analyze 30-second segments, so even short clips (as brief as 10-15 seconds) can work if they contain clear music.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Does it work with copyrighted music?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we can identify copyrighted music in videos. However, we only identify songs - we don't provide downloads or circumvent any copyright protections. We give you the song name and links to legal streaming platforms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
    <div class="feature">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use the full URL</strong> - Copy the complete video link, not shortened versions</li>
            <li><strong>Verify video is public</strong> - Make sure the video is accessible without login</li>
            <li><strong>Choose videos with clear audio</strong> - Higher quality audio = better identification</li>
            <li><strong>Try different videos</strong> - If one video's audio is unclear, try finding the same song in another video</li>
            <li><strong>Check for music credits</strong> - Sometimes creators list songs in descriptions</li>
        </ul>

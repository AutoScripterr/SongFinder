    <h2>Common Questions About Finding Instagram Reel Songs</h2>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Why can't I just tap the audio name in Instagram?</h3>
        <p>While Instagram shows the audio name at the bottom of Reels, this often displays as "Original Audio" or a username, not the actual song name. Even when it shows a song name, it doesn't always link to streaming platforms. Our tool solves both problems by identifying the actual song and providing direct streaming links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can I find songs from Instagram Stories too?</h3>
        <p>Currently, our tool works best with Instagram Reels and regular video posts. Stories are temporary and may have different audio extraction requirements. However, if you have a link to a story, you can try our tool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>What if the Reel has voiceover or dialogue?</h3>
        <p>Many Instagram Reels feature creators talking over background music. Our tool uses advanced audio filtering to isolate and identify the background music even when there's speech, dialogue, or other sound effects layered on top.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Does it work with international Reels?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Instagram is a global platform, and our tool identifies songs in any language - Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and more. We have an extensive international music database.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can I find songs from private Instagram accounts?</h3>
        <p>If you follow the account and can view their Reels, you can copy the URL and use our tool. The Reel just needs to be accessible to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>What if Instagram shows "Use Audio" instead of the song name?</h3>
        <p>This usually means the creator used their own recording or a non-commercial audio clip. Our tool can still analyze it and identify if it contains any recognizable music.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>How is this different from searching on Instagram's audio library?</h3>
        <p>Instagram's audio search only works if you know the song name or artist. Our tool works when you have a Reel URL but don't know what song is playing. We identify the music for you, then you can search for it anywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Can it identify remixes and mashups?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Instagram Reels often feature remixed versions, slowed+reverb edits, or sped-up versions of songs. Our audio recognition technology can identify these variations and tell you the original song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Copy the TikTok Video Link</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the TikTok video with the song you want</li>
            <li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button (arrow icon)</li>
            <li>Select <strong>"Copy Link"</strong></li>
            <li>The URL is now copied to your clipboard</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Use Our TikTok Song Finder</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to our <a href="/">free TikTok song finder tool</a></li>
            <li>Paste the copied URL in the input box</li>
            <li>Click <strong>"Identify Song"</strong></li>
            <li>Wait 20-30 seconds for results</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Get Song Details & Listen</h3>
        <p>You'll instantly see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Song name</strong> - The exact title</li>
            <li><strong>Artist name</strong> - Who created it</li>
            <li><strong>Album</strong> - If available</li>
            <li><strong>Spotify link</strong> - Listen immediately</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Music link</strong> - Alternative streaming</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Method 2: Using TikTok's Built-in Feature</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>TikTok has a built-in way to see song details:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Look at the bottom-right of the video</li>
            <li>You'll see a spinning record icon</li>
            <li>Tap on it to see the sound details</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Limitation</strong>: This only works if the creator tagged the sound. If they used "Original Sound" or didn't tag properly, you won't find the real song name. That's why using our tool (Method 1) is more reliable.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Method 3: Using Shazam</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Shazam is a popular song identification app:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the Shazam app (iOS/Android)</li>
            <li>Play the TikTok video out loud</li>
            <li>Open Shazam and tap the button to listen</li>
            <li>Wait for it to identify the song</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Limitations</strong>: Requires playing audio through speakers (not great in quiet places), may not work well with phone speaker quality, struggles with videos where people talk over music, and can't work with saved TikToks you're viewing silently.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Method 4: Ask in Comments</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The traditional method:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Comment "song?" or "what's the song?"</li>
            <li>Wait for the creator or other users to reply</li>
            <li>Check back in a few hours or days</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Limitations</strong>: Slow (can take hours/days), creator may not respond, other users might give wrong information, and you have to keep checking back.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Method 5: Google the Lyrics</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>If you can hear clear lyrics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Listen closely and write down 3-5 words you hear</li>
            <li>Google search: "[lyrics] song lyrics"</li>
            <li>Look through results for matches</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Limitations</strong>: Only works if lyrics are clear, doesn't work with instrumental music, time-consuming, and lyrics might be misheard.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Common TikTok Song Questions</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>What if TikTok says "Original Sound"?</h3>
        <p>Many TikTokers use songs but label them as "Original Sound" to avoid copyright issues or because they didn't properly tag the audio. Our tool analyzes the actual audio waveform and can identify the real song even if it's labeled as original. We compare it against millions of tracks to find the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Can I find sped up TikTok songs?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Sped up songs (also called "nightcore") are extremely popular on TikTok. Our audio recognition technology identifies both the sped-up version and tells you the original song name, so you can find either version on streaming platforms. This also works for slowed+reverb versions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Does it work with any TikTok video?</h3>
        <p>It works with public TikTok videos that you can access. Private videos (friends-only) won't work unless you have access. Deleted videos also won't work as we need to extract the audio. But as long as you can view and share the video, our tool can identify the music.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>What about TikTok trending sounds?</h3>
        <p>Trending sounds are actually the easiest to identify! Our database is constantly updated with viral TikTok music, so trending songs are recognized instantly. We track what's popular on TikTok daily.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>What if someone is talking over the music?</h3>
        <p>This is super common on TikTok - creators doing voiceovers, POVs, or commentary while music plays in the background. Our tool uses advanced audio filtering technology to isolate and identify the background music even when there's speech, dialogue, or sound effects layered on top.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>How accurate is it compared to Shazam?</h3>
        <p>Our tool is highly accurate and has some advantages over Shazam: it works directly from URLs (no audio playback needed), it analyzes multiple segments of the video automatically (Shazam only listens to what's playing), and it's better at filtering out voice/dialogue. For TikTok specifically, our tool is optimized for the platform's audio characteristics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Can I use this for creating my own TikToks?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Many creators use our tool to discover trending music for their own content. Once you identify a song, you can search for it in TikTok's audio library and use it in your own videos (subject to TikTok's music licensing).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Does it work for TikTok Live videos?</h3>
        <p>For TikTok Live, you'll need to have a saved/recorded version of the live stream with a shareable URL. Live broadcasts in real-time can't be analyzed, but recorded live streams work fine.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Song Not Found?</h3>
        <p>If our tool can't identify the song, try these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify the TikTok isn't using actual "Original Audio" (creator's voice/sounds)</li>
            <li>Check if it's a very new release (might not be in database yet)</li>
            <li>Look for a longer version of the same sound/video</li>
            <li>Search the creator's bio for music credits</li>
            <li>Try finding other TikToks using the same sound</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>URL Not Working?</h3>
        <p>Make sure you're copying the full URL:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Should start with "https://www.tiktok.com/" or "https://vm.tiktok.com/"</li>
            <li>Copy from the TikTok app's share menu, not browser address bar (if different)</li>
            <li>Make sure the video is still public and accessible</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
